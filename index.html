            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I recently completed my Master's in Artificial Intelligence at Duke University, where I specialized in MLOps, machine learning, generative AI, and large language models. At Duke, I worked on projects involving scalable pipelines, model optimization, and explainable AI, applying these skills to real-world problems.</p>

            <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
            
            <h3>Data Scientist - IBM</h3>
            <p>Before pursuing my Master's, I was a Data Scientist at IBM, where I contributed to the development and deployment of IBM's Content Intelligence platform, an Azure-based document intelligence solution. My responsibilities included designing and deploying the platform on Azure Kubernetes Services using Terraform and Jenkins. I also enhanced its capabilities by integrating Azure Form Recognizer for in-depth invoice analysis and developed custom key-value pair recognition models to improve document processing accuracy. Additionally, I played a key role in optimizing the platform's performance, which resulted in significant cost and time savings for enterprise clients.</p>

            <h3>Machine Learning Engineer Co-op - Nokia Bell Labs</h3>
            <p>At Nokia Bell Labs, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer Co-op, focusing on cutting-edge AI solutions. I developed a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot leveraging Llama 3.1 B8 and BGE-M3 embeddings, fine-tuned QLoRA models to enhance query performance by 25%, and designed scalable pipelines for data processing. This role deepened my expertise in large-scale machine learning and natural language processing systems.</p>
